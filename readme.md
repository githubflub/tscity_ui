TS City
===

Visit the site at [https://ts.city](https://ts.city)!

If you want to read/follow the code, here are the entry points:
Entry point for the app is src/main.jsx
Entry point for the build process (npm run build, npm run start) is index.ts

TS City is a recreation of www.teenspot.com, a website from the mid 2000s that featured a chat app, member profiles, and some other features that weren't important like forums and horrible, horrible written content. I used to go there pretty much every day until they shut it down in 2014. I have some nostalgia for the place, so I decided to remake it since I am a programmer...
